TODO JS Lab
===========

Your task is to create a todo list application, similar to the
applications we built in class.

Your app should have a form that allows the user to type in a new
task. It should also have a save button.

Use JavaScript to prevent the form from submitting to the server.
Instead, use your DOM manipulation skills to add the task to the page.

Each task that is added to the page should have a *done* and a *delete*
button. The *done* button strikes through the todo item, the *delete* button removes it. If an item is 'done', the *done* button becomes *undo* and clicking on it removes the strikethrough.
